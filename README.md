# Strikes-Clearlag
Strikes-Clear is designed to help manage server performance by automatically clearing excess entities in the game world. It runs a scheduled task every second to remove entities based on configurable settings, such as clear time and warning time. The plugin sends warnings before clearing entities and can be customized to clear specific entity types.
